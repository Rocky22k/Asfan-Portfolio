                    <h2>Team Leadership</h2>
                    <p>As captain of the MAGS Avengers, I lead a competitive Marvel Rivals team of 6 main members and 2
                        substitutes in the New Zealand Secondary School Esports League. Our team successfully finished
                        in the top 10 nationally, earning us qualification for the prestigious NZ National Esports LAN
                        Event.</p>

                    <p>Leading an esports team requires a unique blend of strategic thinking, communication skills, and
                        the ability to maintain team morale during both victories and defeats. Every match requires
                        split-second decision-making and clear communication under intense pressure.</p>

                        <li>Managing team dynamics and ensuring positive communication</li>
                        <li>Analyzing opponent gameplay and adapting our strategies accordingly</li>
                        <li>Organizing practice schedules and maintaining team commitment</li>
                        <li>Making crucial in-game calls during high-pressure tournament matches</li>

                    <h2>Competitive Achievement</h2>
                    <p>Qualifying for nationals in the New Zealand Secondary School Esports League represents months of
                        dedicated practice, strategic development, and team building. Our top 10 finish demonstrates
                        consistent performance against the best secondary school teams across the country.</p>

                    <p>The Marvel Rivals competitive scene requires not just individual skill, but exceptional teamwork
                        and communication. Each team member plays a specialized role, and success depends on our ability
                        to execute coordinated strategies while adapting to rapidly changing game situations.</p>

                    <h2>Skills Developed</h2>
                    <p>Captaining an esports team has developed leadership skills that extend far beyond gaming.
                        Managing team dynamics, maintaining focus during setbacks, and coordinating strategy under
                        pressure are all transferable skills that benefit my academic and personal projects.</p>

                    <p>The competitive esports environment teaches resilience, strategic thinking, and the importance of
                        continuous improvement - qualities that drive excellence in all areas of life.</p>
