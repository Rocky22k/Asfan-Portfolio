                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>Say Yes to Saving Sand was a class project that became my first real hands-on experience with
                        Flexbox. While the task itself was straightforward, it marked an important milestone in my web
                        development journey - this was the first time I implemented Flexbox properly on my own, without
                        needing constant guidance.</p>

                    <p>The project had a fun twist: instead of serious environmental content, the text on the site ended
                        up being playful descriptions of my classmates and their surroundings. It became a lighthearted
                        way to practice web development while keeping the atmosphere entertaining and relaxed.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="detail-section">
                    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                    <ul class="detail-list">
                        <li>First successful independent use of CSS Flexbox for responsive layouts</li>
                        <li>Clean HTML structure using semantic elements properly</li>
                        <li>Basic responsive design principles and mobile-friendly practices</li>
                        <li>How to balance functionality with personality in web projects</li>
                        <li>Building confidence in tackling CSS layout challenges independently</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="detail-section">
                    <h2>The Fun Factor</h2>
                    <p>While the project was originally meant to focus on environmental awareness, I decided to inject
                        some personality by writing amusing descriptions of my classmates and classroom environment.
                        This creative approach made the development process more engaging and taught me that web
                        projects don't always have to be serious to be valuable learning experiences.</p>

                    <p>The lighthearted content kept me motivated throughout the project and showed me how important it
                        is to find ways to make coding enjoyable, even when working on basic exercises.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="detail-section">
                    <h2>Technical Foundation</h2>
                    <p>This project was all about mastering the fundamentals. The clean structure and straightforward
                        styling gave me a solid foundation that I built upon in later, more complex projects. Most
                        importantly, successfully implementing Flexbox on my own gave me the confidence to tackle more
                        challenging layout techniques in future work.</p>
